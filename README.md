# othello-js
othello game, but in javascript

## description
just a small project meant to practice html/css/js, and to practice using github

i don't plan on making any major updates to this as the core game already works and i'm not necessarily interested in fixing the smaller details

## updates/todo
again, i may or may not get to these

- [ ] show recently played move
- [ ] update endgame card with scores/winner
- [ ] implement fixed-size board
- [ ] split code into their own js files
