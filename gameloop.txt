(change this to md file later?)

each cell has an onclick action that does nothing except if the cell is marked as valid

if the cell is valid:
1. color it the same color as one of its pairs
2. flip everything between the cell and each of its pairs (same as usual)
3. wipe all pairs from board
4. find valid moves of opposite color
    a. if no moves are found, look for moves of the same color
    b. if no moves for either color are found, go to endgame
5. if moves are found, mark valid cells
